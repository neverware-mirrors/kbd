# 1. The input side: the keyboard driver.

# Set the keyboard driver in Unicode mode. (Default is ASCII mode.)
# This really does nothing with the way normal keys are handled in
# the kernel. All it does is:
# - It is necessary for `dumpkeys' in order to not drop U+XXXX
#   entries from the keymaps.
# - It is necessary for `loadkeys' in order to avoid warnings.
# - Unicode characters typed as Alt-x1 ... Alt-xn (where x1,...,xn
#   are digits on the numeric keypad) will be emitted in UTF-8.

# Change the keyboard mapping in such a way that the non-ASCII keys
# produce UTF-8 encoded multibyte sequences, instead of single bytes
# >= 0x80 in a legacy 8-bit encoding.

# 2. The output side: the console screen.

# Tell the console output driver that the bytes arriving are UTF-8
