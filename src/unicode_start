# 1. The input side: the keyboard driver.

# Set the keyboard driver in Unicode mode. (Default is ASCII mode.)
# This really does nothing with the way normal keys are handled in
# the kernel. All it does is:
# - It is necessary for `dumpkeys' in order to not drop U+XXXX
#   entries from the keymaps.
# - It is necessary for `loadkeys' in order to avoid warnings.
# - Unicode characters typed as Alt-x1 ... Alt-xn (where x1,...,xn
#   are digits on the numeric keypad) will be emitted in UTF-8.

kbd_mode -u

# Change the keyboard mapping in such a way that the non-ASCII keys
# produce UTF-8 encoded multibyte sequences, instead of single bytes
# >= 0x80 in a legacy 8-bit encoding.

dumpkeys | loadkeys --unicode

# 2. The output side: the console screen.

# Tell the console output driver that the bytes arriving are UTF-8
# encoded multibyte sequences.

echo -n -e '\033%G'

# Tell the graphics card how to display Unicode characters not
# contained in the IBM 437 character set (on PCs). The font should
# have a Unicode map attached, or explicitly specified, e.g.,
# by giving `def.uni' as a second argument.

DEFAULT_UNICODE_FONT=LatArCyrHeb-16
# Also drdos8x16 is a good candidate.
