This is the Debian-Linux prepackaged version of the Linux console font and
keytable utilities.  loadkeys, dumpkeys and showkey were derived from Risto
Kankkunen's kbd-0.81.  The font loading code goes back to the codepage
package by Joel Hoffman (joel@wam.umd.edu).  (He tells me that the original
reference is: "From: p. 307 of _Programmer's Guide to PC & PS/2 Video
Systems_ by Richard Wilton. 1987.  Microsoft Press".)  The kernel and user
interface for the font loading closely follows Eugene Crosser's intl_con
package.  [Similar things were done earlier by Jerry Kaidor
(tr2!jerry@abekas.com, jkaidor@synoptics.com) : fontpak, H. Peter Anvin
(hpa@nwu.edu) and Pavel Zaboj (xzaboj@vse.cs).  Their code was not used,
but the Latin-1 *.psf fonts were developed by H. Peter Anvin, and the
Latin-2 ones by Pavel Zaboj.]  The current maintainer is Andries Brouwer
<aeb@cwi.nl>.
